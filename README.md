**Technical Plan: Converting the Price Scraper into a Data Stream Producer**

**Objective**

Transform the existing Playwright-based price scraper into a **real-time data streaming producer**, allowing multiple clients to **consume live market data** (ASK, BID, LAST prices).

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Architecture Overview**

**Producer (Scraper)**

‚Ä¢	Runs continuously, fetching price data **every 0.01s**.

‚Ä¢	Publishes the price updates to a **message broker**.

‚Ä¢	Supports **multiple consumers** that subscribe to the price stream.

**Consumers (Clients)**

‚Ä¢	Clients connect via **WebSocket** or **message broker (Kafka, Redis, RabbitMQ, etc.)**.

‚Ä¢	Receive **real-time price updates** without directly scraping the webpage.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Choosing a Message Broker**

To enable multiple connections to receive data, we need a broker. Options:

| **Broker** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Kafka** | High throughput, scalable | Requires setup, not ideal for ultra-low latency |
| **Redis (Pub/Sub)** | Simple, low-latency | No message persistence |
| **RabbitMQ** | Reliable messaging, supports multiple consumers | Can be overkill for simple streaming |
| **WebSockets (FastAPI)** | Lightweight, easy integration with frontend | Requires maintaining connections |

**Best Choice: Redis Pub/Sub**

‚Ä¢	**‚úÖ Lightweight & low-latency**

‚Ä¢	**‚úÖ Easy to scale**

‚Ä¢	**‚úÖ No need for persistent queues**

‚Ä¢	**‚úÖ Simple integration with FastAPI or Flask for WebSocket support**

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation Plan**

**Step 1: Set Up Redis Pub/Sub**

‚Ä¢	Install Redis locally or use a cloud-hosted Redis service.

‚Ä¢	Use aioredis (Python async Redis client) for handling Pub/Sub.

**Step 2: Modify the Scraper to Publish Price Data**

‚Ä¢	Instead of writing to a CSV, publish messages to a Redis channel (market_data).

‚Ä¢	Each message contains:

```
{
  "timestamp": "2025-02-19 08:02:05.053",
  "symbol": "ES",
  "ASK": "22258.75",
  "BID": "22255.50",
  "LAST": "22257.00"
}
```

**Step 3: Implement a WebSocket Server for Clients**

‚Ä¢	Use **FastAPI with WebSockets** to allow clients to connect and receive live updates.

‚Ä¢	When a client connects, subscribe to Redis Pub/Sub and stream messages.

**Step 4: Implement Consumer Clients**

‚Ä¢	Clients can:

‚Ä¢	**Use WebSockets** for real-time updates.

‚Ä¢	**Use a Redis subscriber** if they prefer message queues.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ System Components**

**Producer (Price Scraper)**

‚Ä¢	Fetches prices every **0.01s**.

‚Ä¢	Publishes data to **Redis Pub/Sub** (market_data channel).

**WebSocket Server (FastAPI)**

‚Ä¢	Bridges the **producer** and **consumers**.

‚Ä¢	Listens to Redis and **pushes data via WebSockets**.

**Consumers**

‚Ä¢	**WebSocket-based clients** (Web frontend, Python apps, etc.).

‚Ä¢	**Redis subscribers** (for backend services needing price updates).

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Key Technologies**

| **Component** | **Technology** |
| --- | --- |
| Web Scraper | Playwright |
| Message Broker | Redis Pub/Sub |
| Streaming Protocol | WebSockets (FastAPI) |
| Consumer Clients | Python, JavaScript (WebSockets) |

**6Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps**

**Phase 1: Implement the Producer (Scraper)**

‚úÖ Modify the Playwright script to publish data to Redis.

‚úÖ Ensure stable retries with tenacity.

**Phase 2: Implement the WebSocket Server**

‚úÖ Set up FastAPI with a WebSocket endpoint.

‚úÖ Connect it to Redis and **stream real-time updates**.

**Phase 3: Implement Consumer Clients**

‚úÖ Create a sample WebSocket client to test data streaming.

‚úÖ Implement Redis-based consumers if needed.

**Final Outcome**

A **scalable** and **real-time price streaming system**, allowing multiple clients to **connect and consume live market data** efficiently. üöÄ
